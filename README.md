# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some Oxlint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the Oxlint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and Oxlint's TypeScript related rules in your project.

## Features (Planned)

- Authentication
- Role-based Dashboard
- Job Listings
- Job Search & Filters
- Resume Upload
- Candidate Dashboard
- Recruiter Dashboard
- Protected Routes
- Form Validation
- REST API Integration
- Toast Notifications
- Responsive UI

## Application Layout

The application uses two primary layouts:

### MainLayout

Used for authenticated pages.

Includes:

- Navbar
- Sidebar
- Main Content
- Footer

### AuthLayout

Used for authentication pages such as:

- Login
- Register
- Forgot Password

This keeps authentication screens separate from the main application interface and promotes reusable layout components.

## Pages

The project includes the following route-level pages:

- Login
- Signup
- Dashboard
- Jobs
- Profile
- Not Found (404)

Authentication pages use `AuthLayout`, while protected application pages use `MainLayout` to maintain a consistent user interface.

## Current Progress

- ✅ Project initialized with Vite
- ✅ Installed project dependencies
- ✅ Cleaned Vite starter template
- ✅ Created scalable folder structure
- ✅ Configured React Router
- ✅ Create application layouts
- ✅ Create initial application pages
