# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some Oxlint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the Oxlint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and Oxlint's TypeScript related rules in your project.

# Smart Applicant Tracking System

## Features (Planned)

- Authentication
- Role-based Dashboard
- Job Listings
- Job Search & Filters
- Resume Upload
- Candidate Dashboard
- Recruiter Dashboard
- Protected Routes
- Form Validation
- REST API Integration
- Toast Notifications
- Responsive UI

## Application Layout

The application uses two primary layouts:

### MainLayout

Used for authenticated pages.

Includes:

- Navbar
- Sidebar
- Main Content
- Footer

### AuthLayout

Used for authentication pages such as:

- Login
- Register
- Forgot Password

This keeps authentication screens separate from the main application interface and promotes reusable layout components.

## Pages

The project includes the following route-level pages:

- Login
- Signup
- Dashboard
- Jobs
- Profile
- Not Found (404)

Authentication pages use `AuthLayout`, while protected application pages use `MainLayout` to maintain a consistent user interface.


## Authentication Module

The application includes a complete authentication user interface built with reusable components.

### Screens

- Login
- Signup
- Forgot Password
- Reset Password

### Technologies

- React Hook Form
- Yup Validation
- React Toastify (prepared for notifications)

Authentication logic and backend integration will be implemented in a later phase.


## Form Validation

Authentication forms use:

- React Hook Form
- Yup
- @hookform/resolvers

### Features

- Reusable validation schemas
- Client-side validation
- Inline error messages
- Password confirmation validation
- Minimal re-renders for better performance

## API Configuration

The project uses a centralized Axios instance.

### Features

- Base URL from environment variables
- JSON request headers
- Request interceptor for JWT authentication
- Response interceptor for global error handling
- Configurable timeout

Environment variables are managed using Vite's `.env` files.


## Authentication

Authentication is implemented using a dedicated service layer and centralized state management.

### Features

- Login
- Signup
- Logout
- Refresh Token support
- JWT decoding
- Persistent authentication state
- Axios request/response interceptors

### Architecture

```

```

## Global State Management

The application uses React Context API for global state management.

### Contexts

- **AuthContext** – Authentication and session management
- **ThemeContext** – Light/Dark mode
- **UserContext** – User profile and preferences

### Architecture

```
AppProvider
├── AuthProvider
├── ThemeProvider
└── UserProvider
```

Custom hooks (`useAuth`, `useTheme`, `useUser`) are used to simplify context consumption throughout the application.

## Routing & Authorization

The application uses React Router with route guards.

### Features

- Protected Routes
- Public Routes
- JWT Authentication
- Role-Based Authorization
- Unauthorized (403) Page
- Automatic Redirect After Login

### Supported Roles

- Admin
- Recruiter
- Candidate
